        <p>I build a lot of tools - a lot that I find personally beneficial.  For this one in particular, I wanted an application to help 
          me learn how to play the piano.  I wanted to to work on the desktop, as well as work on tablets that can interact directly with a keyboard.  In this way, 
          it'd be possible to learn the piano in a "rock band" manner, and keep score to see how well I can play along with songs.  More features that enable this behavior will hopefully
          be coming soon :).
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to use it and if you log in, you'll be able to request features you'd like to see -- this will most likely be a paid member feature only down the road while the main app will
          remain largely free.  
          </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
